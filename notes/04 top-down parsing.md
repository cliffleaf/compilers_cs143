### Intro to Parsing

Parser takes a string of tokens (generated by lexer) and outputs a parse tree

We need a method for distinguishing between valid and invalid strings of tokens. 



### Context Free Languages

A Context Free Language (CFG) is a natural notation for recursive structures of a programme.

It consists of:

- A set of terminals T

- A set of non-terminals N

- A start symbol $$S\in N$$

- A set of productions 

  $$\{X\rightarrow Y_1 ... Y_i\}$$ where $$X\in N\ and\ Y\in N\cup T\cup \{\epsilon\}$$



Translates the start string to some other strings

1. Start with input tokens $$X_1 ... X_i$$
2. Replace a non-terminal X by its production ($$Y_1 ... Y_i$$)
3. Repeat until no non-terminal symbols exists
